              <p>A shareholders agreement governs the relationship between the shareholders and the directors of a company. LegalVision’s corporate and commercial lawyers can assist with drafting and reviewing shareholders agreements.</p>
              <p>As no two businesses are the same, a shareholders agreement should be customised and cover all potential scenarios that a business may face. A shareholders agreement provides distinct advantages over the replaceable rules in the Corporations Act (a default set of rules for the internal management) or a standard form company constitution. LegalVision’s business lawyers can draft or review shareholders agreements and advise on the following:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>issuing new shares;</li>
                <li>sale of existing shares;</li>
                <li>directors’ duties;</li>
                <li>conduct of board and shareholders meetings; and</li>
                <li>dispute resolution.</li>
              
              </ul>
  
              <p>Our commercial lawyers have extensive experience in drafting shareholders agreements to suit the particular circumstances of founders, investors and owner-operators. In addition to shareholders agreements, we can provide assistance with drafting share subscription agreements, share vesting agreements, buy/sell agreements and employee share schemes. We can also advise on business structuring and assist in resolving shareholder disputes.</p>

                  <li> Businesses lend and borrow money regularly. Business loans can be simple or complex. The interests of the borrower and the lender are very different, and it’s important that the loan documentation, and any security documents, are drafted in a way which works for both parties.</li>
                  <li> The most important document in a loan transaction is the loan agreement (or facility agreement). A loan agreement sets out the obligations of both the lender and the borrower. The most important clauses in a loan agreement relate to the amount borrowed, the repayment schedule, the interest rate and the type of security to be granted.</li>
                  <li>There is a big distinction between a secured loan agreement and an unsecured loan agreement. Securing a loan means taking security over some or all of the assets of the borrower. If the borrower does not make the required repayments under the loan agreement then the lender can take possession of the assets in order to repay the debt.</li>
                  <li>The lender will generally try and ensure that the loan is secured and uncommitted (meaning the lender isn’t required to lend the money). The borrower will seek to ensure that the loan is unsecured, if at all possible.</li>
                  <li>The type of security granted will depend on the loan. A general security agreement is a common form of security, which grants security over all of a company’s assets. If the loan is specific to a certain piece of equipment, a charge might be more appropriate. In Australia, security can be “perfected” via registration through the Personal Property Securities Register (PPSR).</li>
